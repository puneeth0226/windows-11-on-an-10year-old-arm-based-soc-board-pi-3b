    <p style="text-align: justify;">c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To distribute the Software to Third Parties for use with or incorporation into Licensee Products or Third Party Products, provided that Licensee ensures that: (i) such Third Party agrees to be bound by
        this Agreement (in writing or by "click to accept"), and (ii) this Agreement accompanies such distribution.&nbsp; The procedure described in sub-clauses (i) and (ii) is not required when the Software is embedded in machine-readable object code
        form as firmware in Licensee Products or Third Party Products.&nbsp; Further, the procedure described in sub-clauses (i) and (ii) is not required when modified versions of PC programs are re-distributed in machine-readable object code form, provided
        that Licensee notifies end users that: (1) the modified PC program is derived from a Microchip PC program and is governed by the terms of this Agreement including the requirement to use such program with Microchip Products, (2) a copy of this
        Agreement is available upon request, and (3) the Licensee supports the modified PC program.&nbsp;
    </p>

        This includes, by way of example but not as a limitation, any standards setting organizations requirements and, particularly with respect to Security Package Software, if any, local encryption laws and requirements.&nbsp; Microchip is not responsible

        licensed under such license, requires that the distributor make the software available in source code format.&nbsp; To the extent required by the licenses covering Open Source Components, the terms of such license will apply in lieu of the terms
        of this Agreement.&nbsp; To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to Open Source Components prohibit any of the restrictions in this Agreement with respect to such Open Source Components, such restrictions will not apply to such Open
        Source Component.

        <strong>&nbsp; </strong>Licensee will not: (a) engage in unauthorized use, modification, disclosure or distribution of Software or Documentation, or its modifications or derivatives; (b) use all or any portion of the Software, Documentation, or
        its modifications or derivatives except in conjunction with Microchip Products, Licensee Products, or Third Party Products as set forth in this Agreement; or (c) reverse engineer (by disassembly, decompilation or otherwise) Software or any portion
        thereof.
        <strong>&nbsp; </strong>Licensee may not remove or alter any Microchip copyright or other proprietary rights notice posted in any portion of the Software or Documentation.&nbsp; Licensee will defend, indemnify and hold Microchip and its subsidiaries
        harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees), liabilities, and losses, including without limitation: (x) any claims directly or indirectly arising from or related to the use, modification,
        disclosure or distribution of the Software, Documentation, or any intellectual property rights related thereto; (y) the use, sale and distribution of Licensee Products or Third Party Products; and (z) breach of this Agreement.&nbsp;

        </strong>
        <strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Licensee agrees that the Software (including but not limited to the source code, object code and library files) and its modifications or derivatives, Documentation and underlying inventions, algorithms, know-how and ideas
        relating to the Software and the Documentation are proprietary information belonging to Microchip and its licensors ("Proprietary Information").&nbsp; Except as expressly and unambiguously allowed herein, Licensee will hold in confidence and not
        use or disclose any Proprietary Information and will similarly bind its employees and Third Party(ies) in writing.&nbsp; Proprietary Information will not include information that: (i) is in or enters the public domain without breach of this Agreement
        and through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) the receiving party was legally in possession of prior to receiving it; (iii) the receiving party can demonstrate was developed by the receiving party independently and without use of or reference
        to the disclosing party's Proprietary Information; or (iv) the receiving party receives from a third party without restriction on disclosure.&nbsp; If Licensee is required to disclose Proprietary Information by law, court order, or government
        agency, License will give Microchip prompt notice of such requirement in order to allow Microchip to object or limit such disclosure.&nbsp; Licensee agrees that the provisions of this Agreement regarding unauthorized use and nondisclosure of the
        Software, Documentation and related Proprietary Rights are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of Microchip and its licensors and that monetary damage alone cannot adequately compensate Microchip or its licensors if such provisions
        are violated.&nbsp; Licensee, therefore, agrees that if Microchip alleges that Licensee or Third Party has breached or violated such provision then Microchip will have the right to injunctive relief, without the requirement for the posting of
        a bond, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity.</p>
